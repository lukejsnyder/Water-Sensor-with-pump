# Project Description
# Video
  In this youtube video I was using a 5v relay instead of a 3v one. I was not able to have the pump connected without an external power source. I instead connected it to my pi to show to proof of concept. When you are building your own remeber to get a 3v relay.

# What problem does my project solve?
  Solves the problem of remebering to water your plant.   
# How is it internet connected?
  Around 3 times a day the sensor will trigger and the level will be transfered to losant. If the level is below a certain threshhold
  it will automatically water the plant and send you a text that it has been watered. 
# Hardware
  NodeMCU, 3.3v Relay, moisture sensor with potentiometer, 3-6v pump, Power supply, jumper cables
